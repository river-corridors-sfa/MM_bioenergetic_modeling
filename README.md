# bioenergetic_modeling
This repository is the modeling archive in support of a River Corridor SFA publication "Thermodynamic control on the decomposition of organic matter across different electron acceptors".  All scripts are in R.

Model: scripts to calculate free energy change of reactions and energy efficiency across different electron acceptors

Input_FTICR: FTICR based organic matter composition data, used as input of bioenergetic models (see Boye et al., 2018 Discerning microbially mediated processes during redox transitions in flooded soils using carbon and energy balances)

Model_output: model output files and sensitivity analysis. All files were named after "soil"+"treatment" ("1" for controls)

Output_processing: cybernetic modeling and graphing scripts
